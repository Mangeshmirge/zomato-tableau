Most Zomato-listed restaurants are low-cost (0â€“300 range), with India leading in customer votes. Openings peaked in 2011 and remained steady after. Few restaurants offer online delivery (25.66%) or table booking (12.12%), showing service adoption gaps and growth potential in convenience features.
